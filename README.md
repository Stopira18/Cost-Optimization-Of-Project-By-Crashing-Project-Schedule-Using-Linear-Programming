# Cost-Optimization-Of-Project-By-Crashing-Project-Schedule-Using-Linear-Programming

In today’s competitive surroundings finishing a project among time and budget, is extremely difficult task for the project managers. 
Value and time alongside quality of the project play important role in construction project’s decision. 
For surprising reasons, a project would possibly run behind the schedule that decision upon a project manager to blinking one 
or additional of the project’s activities by hiring additional resources. On the choice of expediting the project, 
a linear programming math model was developed to attenuate the value of the project related to the expedition of activities.
This aim of this study is to develop a model that finds a correct trade-off between time and price to expedite the execution process
